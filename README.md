# My Emacs config

This Emacs config is inspired by David Wilsons Emacs from scratch series on youtube.
You can find the configuration for the series [here](https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch)

## After cloning the repo
After you cloned the repo and start emacs you need to run

```emacs-lisp
M-x load-file RET
~/.emacs.d/bootstrap.el
```

This will initialize the package management, tangle Init.org and load the created init.el
